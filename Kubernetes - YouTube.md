### Intro and Course Overview

Chapter 1 of the Kubernetes Crash Course for Absolute Beginners introduces the course and its instructor, Nana, who has experience teaching DevOps skills. The chapter outlines what will be covered in the course, including an overview of Kubernetes, its architecture, main components, and a hands-on demo project. The course aims to provide a basic understanding of Kubernetes for beginners, with the option to further deepen knowledge through a complete Kubernetes administrator course.

### What is Kubernetes

Chapter 2 of the Kubernetes Crash Course for Absolute Beginners delves into the definition of Kubernetes as an open-source container orchestration framework originally developed by Google. It explains how Kubernetes helps manage applications made up of hundreds or thousands of containers in various environments, such as physical machines, virtual machines, cloud environments, or hybrid deployment environments. The chapter also discusses the problems Kubernetes solves, such as ensuring high availability, scalability, and disaster recovery for containerized applications. Kubernetes and other container orchestration tools offer these functionalities to make applications more flexible and resilient in handling varying workloads and potential infrastructure issues.

### Kubernetes Architecture

Chapter 3 of the Kubernetes Crash Course for Absolute Beginners explains the basic architecture of a Kubernetes cluster. It consists of at least one master node and multiple worker nodes. The master node runs essential Kubernetes processes like the API server, controller manager, scheduler, and etcd key-value storage. The worker nodes have containers of different applications deployed on them, and the scheduler is responsible for intelligently scheduling containers on different nodes based on workload and available resources. The virtual network connects all nodes in the cluster, turning them into a powerful machine. It is crucial to have backups of the master node in production environments to ensure the cluster's continued smooth operation. The chapter also discusses the main Kubernetes components that administrators and users work with to deploy applications effectively.

### Node & Pod

Chapter 4 of the Kubernetes Crash Course for Absolute Beginners delves into the setup of a worker node, also known as a node in Kubernetes terminology. A node can be a physical or virtual machine, and the fundamental unit in Kubernetes is a pod. A pod is an abstraction over a container, creating a layer on top of it to simplify management and allow for easy replacement of container runtimes. Pods can run multiple containers, but typically, they are meant to run one main application container. Kubernetes provides a virtual network that assigns each pod its own internal IP address for communication. Pods are ephemeral, meaning they can easily die and be replaced, which is where the concept of services in Kubernetes comes into play for maintaining consistent communication.

### Service & Ingress

Chapter 5 of the Kubernetes Crash Course for Absolute Beginners discusses the concept of services in Kubernetes. A service provides a static or permanent IP address that can be attached to each pod, allowing for consistent communication even if the pod dies. External services open communication to external sources, while internal services restrict access to public requests. The chapter also introduces the concept of Ingress in Kubernetes, which allows for secure communication with a domain name and protocol, enhancing the accessibility of applications. Overall, this chapter provides a foundational understanding of how services work in Kubernetes and sets the stage for exploring more advanced features in the future.

### ConfigMap & Secret

Chapter 6 of the Kubernetes Crash Course for Absolute Beginners delves into the importance of external configurations in Kubernetes. It explains how pods communicate with each other using services, such as a MongoDB service for database communication. The chapter introduces ConfigMaps, which store configuration data like database URLs, and Secrets, which store sensitive data like passwords in an encoded format. ConfigMaps and Secrets allow for easy adjustment of configurations without the need to rebuild the application image, enhancing security and efficiency in Kubernetes deployments.

### Volume

Chapter 7 of the Kubernetes Crash Course for Absolute Beginners focuses on data storage in Kubernetes. It explains the importance of persisting data in a database pod to prevent data loss when the pod is restarted. The chapter introduces the concept of volumes in Kubernetes, which attach physical storage to a pod, either locally on the same server node or remotely outside the Kubernetes cluster. It emphasizes the responsibility of the Kubernetes user or administrator to manage data persistence, backups, and hardware for storage, as Kubernetes does not handle data persistence on its own.

### Deployment & StatefulSet

Chapter 8 of the Kubernetes Crash Course for Absolute Beginners delves into the concept of replication and load balancing in Kubernetes. It explains how to ensure high availability and prevent downtime by replicating application pods and database pods across multiple nodes in the cluster. The chapter introduces the Deployment component in Kubernetes, which allows users to define a blueprint for a pod and specify the number of replicas to run. It also discusses the StatefulSet component, specifically designed for stateful applications like databases, to manage data synchronization and avoid inconsistencies. The chapter emphasizes the importance of using StatefulSets for database applications and highlights the challenges of deploying database applications within a Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, it mentions the option of hosting database applications outside the Kubernetes cluster for easier management. The chapter concludes by highlighting the robustness of a setup with replicated pods and load-balanced services, ensuring continuous availability even in the event of node failures.

### Kubernetes Configuration

Chapter 9 of the Kubernetes Crash Course for Absolute Beginners focuses on the practical aspect of creating components like pods and services in a Kubernetes cluster. It explains that all configuration in a Kubernetes cluster is managed through a master node via the API server. Various Kubernetes clients, such as a UI like Kubernetes Dashboard or a command-line tool like kubectl, interact with the API server to send configuration requests in YAML or JSON format. The chapter provides an example of a configuration request to create a Deployment component, which serves as a blueprint for creating pods. It also discusses the declarative nature of configuration requests in Kubernetes, where users declare their desired outcome, and Kubernetes works to meet those requirements automatically. The chapter further explains the structure of configuration files in Kubernetes, including metadata, specification, and status parts, with the status being automatically generated and updated by Kubernetes to ensure the desired state is maintained. It also emphasizes the importance of storing configuration files with application code for better management and version control.

### Minikube and Kubectl - Setup K8s cluster locally

Chapter 10 of the Kubernetes Crash Course for Absolute Beginners delves into the practical aspects of setting up MiniKube and Kubectl. MiniKube is a tool used for testing Kubernetes components on a local machine, providing a single-node cluster where both master and worker processes run. Kubectl, on the other hand, is a command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. The chapter explains how to install and run MiniKube, including selecting the correct driver (such as Docker) and starting the MiniKube cluster. It also covers how to check the status of the cluster and interact with it using Kubectl. The chapter emphasizes that Kubectl is not just for MiniKube clusters but can be used to interact with any type of Kubernetes cluster setup.

### Complete Demo Project: Deploy WebApp with MongoDB

Chapter 11 of the Kubernetes Crash Course for Absolute Beginners focuses on deploying a simple but realistic application setup in a Kubernetes cluster. The chapter covers deploying a MongoDB database and a web application that connects to the MongoDB database using external configuration data from ConfigMap and Secret. The chapter explains how to create Kubernetes configuration files for the deployment setup, including ConfigMap for MongoDB endpoint, Secret for username and password, Deployment and Service for MongoDB, and Deployment and Service for the web application. The chapter also discusses passing data from ConfigMap and Secret to the application as environment variables, configuring connectivity with the database, and making the web application accessible externally from the browser by setting the Service type to NodePort. The chapter concludes with creating and checking all the components in the Kubernetes cluster using kubectl apply commands.

### Interacting with Kubernetes Cluster

Chapter 12 of the Kubernetes Crash Course for Absolute Beginners delves into using the command line interface to interact with the Kubernetes cluster. The chapter demonstrates how to use 'kubectl get all' to view all components created in the cluster, including deployments, pods, and services. It also covers accessing ConfigMap and Secret using 'kubectl get configmap' and 'kubectl get secret' commands. The chapter explains how to use 'kubectl describe' to get detailed information about specific components, 'kubectl logs' to view container logs, and how to access services from the browser using the node port service. Additionally, it highlights the importance of troubleshooting, debugging, and validating applications in the Kubernetes cluster.
