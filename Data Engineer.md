Data modeling is the process of creating a simplified diagram of a software system and the data elements it contains, using text and symbols to represent the data and how it flows. Data models provide a blueprint for designing a new database or reengineering a legacy application. Overall, data modeling helps an organization use its data effectively to meet business needs for information.
### Conceptual data model
This is a high-level visualization of the business or analytics processes that a system will support. It maps out the kinds of data that are needed, how different business entities interrelate and associated business rules. Business executives are the main audience for conceptual data models, to help them see how a system will work and ensure that it meets business needs. Conceptual models aren't tied to specific database or application technologies.

### 2. Logical data model.
Once a conceptual data model is finished, it can be used to create a less-abstract logical one. Logical data models show how data entities are related and describe the data from a technical perspective. For example, they define data structures and provide details on attributes, keys, data types and other characteristics. The technical side of an organization uses logical models to help understand required application and database designs. But like conceptual models, they aren't connected to a particular technology platform.

### 3. Physical data model.
A logical model serves as the basis for the [creation of a physical data model](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/answer/Steps-for-converting-a-logical-data-model-into-a-physical-data-model). Physical models are specific to the [database management system](https://searchsqlserver.techtarget.com/definition/database-management-system) (DBMS) or application software that will be implemented. They define the structures that the database or a file system will use to store and manage the data. That includes tables, columns, fields, indexes, constraints, triggers and other DBMS elements. Database designers use physical data models to create designs and generate schema for databases.
