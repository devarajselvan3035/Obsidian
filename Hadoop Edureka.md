## What is Big Data? Introduction to Big Data | Hadoop Tutorial for Beginners | Hadoop [Part 1]

### What is Big Data

Big Data is a term related to IT that involves handling and analyzing large amounts of data. The concept can be understood through practical use cases, such as managing sales data for a retail company. In the early 2000s, before the advent of mobile phones and social media, data was stored using DBMS systems.

### What is DBMS

Chapter 2 discusses the limitations of traditional DBMS systems in handling large amounts of data and the need for organizations like ICICI Bank to migrate to Big Data platforms like Hadoop to address these challenges. The chapter highlights the issues faced by ICICI Bank and the benefits of transitioning to Big Data technology.

### What is a table

Chapter 3 discusses how traditional DBMS systems store data in tables, which can handle small to medium-sized data sets. However, as data sizes grow into the terabytes, traditional systems like MySQL or Oracle may struggle to efficiently manage and process this large volume of data. This limitation highlights the need for Big Data technologies like Hadoop to handle massive data sets effectively.

### Storage

Chapter 4 discusses the challenges of managing increasing data volumes in traditional DBMS systems like Oracle. As data continues to grow, organizations may face difficulties in storing and processing this data efficiently. The chapter emphasizes the need for a solution that can handle both storage and processing effectively, such as Hadoop.

### Oracle Storage

Chapter 5 discusses the limitations of traditional database systems like Oracle in terms of storage capacity and data organization. It highlights the challenges of dividing data as storage increases and the need for a more scalable solution like Hadoop to efficiently store and manage large volumes of data.

### Normalization

Chapter 6 delves into the concept of data normalization in database management systems to prevent data duplication and the use of join queries to retrieve data from multiple tables. It also discusses the challenges of processing large amounts of data and the need for logical partitioning and denormalization to improve query performance. Additionally, it introduces the concept of NoSQL databases for storing and retrieving unstructured data efficiently, highlighting their scalability and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional relational databases. The chapter emphasizes the importance of big data analysis in various industries and the role of different database technologies in managing and processing vast amounts of data effectively.

### NoSQL databases

Chapter 7 discusses the concept of polyglot persistence in the world of big data, where there are separate systems known as NoSQL databases for real-time data queries. Examples of NoSQL databases mentioned include MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase, and others, which are commonly used for fetching real-time data in applications like e-commerce websites or flight booking platforms. The chapter highlights the importance of coexistence between traditional relational databases and NoSQL databases in managing and processing large volumes of data effectively.
