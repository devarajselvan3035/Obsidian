### Aggregations
**OLAP** - Online Analytical Processing

### What is a Database?
**RELATIONAL DATABASE**
• Designed to capture and record data
(OLTP)
• Live, real-time data
• Data Stored in tables with rows and columns
• Data is highly detailed
• Flexible Schema (how the data is organized)

### What is a Data Warehouse?
**RELATIONAL** **DATABASE**

• Designed for analytical processing (OLAP)
• Data is refreshed from source systems stores current and historical
• Data is summarized
• Rigid Schema (how the data is organized)

### What is a Data Lake?
**RELATIONAL DATABASE**
• Designed to capture raw data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured)
• Made for large amounts of data
• Used for ML and Al in its current state or for Analytics with processing
• Can organize and put into Databases or Data Warehouses
### Key Differences between database and data warehouse
• Databases are designed for Transactions, Data Warehouses are designed for analytics and reporting
• Databases data is fresh and detailed, Data Warehouses data is refreshed periodically and is summarized
• Databases work slowly for querying large amounts of data and can slow down transactional processes, Data Warehouses don't interfere with any processes and are generally faster
